<p>A human activity recognition data from the UCR archive. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones</p>


HAR contains recordings of 30 health volunteers aged 19-48 years old. The six classes are


<li>walking
<li>walking upstairs
<li>walking downstairs
<li>sitting
<li>standing
<li>laying. 

<p>A video of the experiment including an example of the six recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A

<p>The wearable sensors on a smartphone measure triaxial linear acceleration
and triaxial angular velocity at 50 Hz. The UCI data has six channels. This data was preprocessed in [1] and downloaded from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TF-C_Pretrain_HAR/19930244. It has just three channels representing the body
linear acceleration. 

The original UCI data has 10299 instances split into 70% train and 30% test. with separate subjects in train and test. This data was split into train (5881 cases), validation (1471) and test (2947).  We have added the validation set to the end of the train file to ease reproduction if a validation set is needed.
